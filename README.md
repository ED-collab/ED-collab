- 👋 Hi, I’m Erik Delaquis
- 👀 I’m interested in agricultural research & development, especially interdisciplinary approaches related to seed systems, plant disease epidemics, agronomy, farmer management of genetic resources, writing super sloppy code in R, developing and validating tools for practitioners...
- 👀 You can see some of my published work by checking out my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kj5h8UcAAAAJ&hl=en), [ORCiD record](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1427-6572), and [Publons peer review activity](https://publons.com/researcher/4691015/erik-delaquis/peer-review/). I cofounded a seed systems toolbox with tested, evidence-based tools for understanding and intervening in seed systems available at [https://tools4seedsystems.org/](https://tools4seedsystems.org/)
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a number of projects evaluating seed networks, degeneration, exchange behaviours, and spatial analysis of cassava's rise in Southeast Asia. I also lead a project evaluating the diversity and management of traditional varieties of an indigenous group in the Peruvian Amazon.
- 💞️ seed use and exchange scenario modeling, spatial analysis of cropping patterns and varietal use, ML approaches for disease risk and spread...
