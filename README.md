- 👋 Hi, I’m Erik Delaquis
- 👀 I’m interested in agricultural research & development, especially interdisciplinary approaches related to seed systems, plant disease epidemics, agronomy, farmer management of genetic resources, and writing super sloppy code in R.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a number of projects evaluating seed networks, degeneration, exchange behaviours, and spatial analysis of cassava's rise in Southeast Asia. I also lead a project evaluating the diversity and management oftraditional varieties of an indigenous group in the Peruvian Amazon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on seed use and exchange scenario modeling, spatial analysis of cropping patterns and varietal use, and more
